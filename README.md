9. Bidirectional Foot Traffic Monitor for Single Entry Spaces
Project Description:
A system to count foot traffic in and out of a room, and display traffic and timing information on a smartphone.
Project Specifications:
    • The system will be designed for a room with only one door, so that monitoring the foot traffic in and out will allow the system to determine room occupancy.
    • The team will select sensors that can be used to detect entries and exits, and interface them with appropriate hardware and software to count each such event.
    • The cost and size of computing hardware should be minimized, subject to the
requirements of the sensors and detection algorithm. For example, a Raspberry Pi may not be used if the computing requirements can be satisfied with an Arduino nano.
    • The system will keep a count of room occupancy, and will detect when occupancy exceeds room capacity.
    • The monitor system will communicate wirelessly with a server that organizes the data to be provided to users’ cell phones. The system will alert users when room capacity is exceeded.
    • The system will include a smartphone app to view traffic, timing and occupancy data, and receive alerts.
